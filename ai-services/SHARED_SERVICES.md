# Shared MCP and RAG services

These services run on the host machine, outside Docker Compose. Feature backends
run in Docker and supply student-scoped data to the shared services.

## Local addresses

| Service | Host process | Address from a Docker container |
|---|---|---|
| MCP | `python ai-services/mcp-server/server.py` | `http://host.docker.internal:8011/mcp` |
| RAG | `python ai-services/rag-server/server.py` | `http://host.docker.internal:8012` |
| Agentic loop | `python ai-services/agentic-loop/app.py` | `http://host.docker.internal:5012` |

The host can use `127.0.0.1` instead of `host.docker.internal`.

## MCP tools

Add feature tools to `ai-services/mcp-server/server.py` using `@mcp.tool()`.
Give each tool a feature-prefixed name, typed inputs, a short description,
and a structured return type. For example, the existing tool is
`assessments_get_upcoming(student_id, days_ahead=14)`.

Feature code should call tools through an MCP client. The `/mcp` address is an
MCP transport endpoint, not an ordinary JSON REST endpoint.

The feature backend is responsible for determining the current student and
passing that student's ID. A tool must fetch or return only records that the
student is permitted to access.

## RAG request

Feature backends send `POST /answer` with JSON:

```json
{
  "query": "When is my Architecture Report due?",
  "feature": "assessments",
  "student_id": 1,
  "k": 5,
  "documents": [
    {
      "feature": "assessments",
      "student_id": 1,
      "chunk_id": "assessment:11",
      "source_id": "assessment:11",
      "authority_tier": "tier_1",
      "text": "The Architecture Report is due on 2026-10-05."
    }
  ]
}
```

`k` is optional and defaults to 5. Each `chunk_id` must be unique within the
request. Use a stable `source_id` that the frontend can show to the student.
The backend prepares fresh documents from its own records for each request.
The RAG server does not maintain a persistent student corpus.

The backend must fetch only the current student's records. The RAG server
checks that supplied document `feature` and `student_id` values match the
request, but it does not authenticate users.

## RAG response

A grounded answer has this shape:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "query": "When is my Architecture Report due?",
  "answer": "[assessment:11]: 2026-10-05",
  "citations": ["assessment:11"],
  "confidence": "Context Available",
  "sources": [
    {
      "chunk_id": "assessment:11",
      "source_id": "assessment:11",
      "authority_tier": "tier_1",
      "text": "The Architecture Report is due on 2026-10-05."
    }
  ]
}
```

If relevant context is unavailable, `status` is `insufficient_context`,
`citations` and `sources` are empty, and `confidence` is
`Insufficient Context`. `Context Available` means cited context was retrieved;
it is not a probability or a guarantee that the generated answer is correct.

`POST /retrieve` accepts the same request and returns ranked context without
calling Ollama. `GET /health` checks whether the RAG HTTP server is running.

## Shared loop validation

The local agentic loop provides separate validation modes:

- `POST http://localhost:5012/validate-mcp` checks MCP tool discovery.
- `POST http://localhost:5012/validate-rag` checks RAG retrieval with a synthetic document.
- `POST http://localhost:5012/validate-now` runs both checks.

The normal polling loop also runs both checks. These checks do not execute
feature tools or assess the accuracy of generated answers.
